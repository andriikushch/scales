Scales is a hobby project created out of passion for both music theory and coding. The goal is to explore and deepen the understanding of musical scales while experimenting with algorithmic generation and visualization.

✨ What It Does

- Generates basic musical scales
- Visualizes scales on a guitar fretboard
- Supports Major, Minor, and Pentatonic scales

Example:

```
go run main.go -scale pentatonic -pentatonicType minor -key A -instrument guitar
```
